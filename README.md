# Ambilike
Ambilight like experience using a normal Android device and the Philips Hue system. Needs a rooted device.

# How to use
The app is rather easy: It takes a screenshot of the device as often as it can (currently every 350-500ms on my device, a MINIX Neo 7), analyses the dominant color and sends it to your Hue bridge.

Just download the apk file, install it, connect to your bridge, choose the lights you want to use and fiddle around with the settings.

# Please note
This is should be considered as a "works-for-me proof of concept". It runs stable on my device and the effect is not perfect but I enjoy it very much. This is my first Android app, so please bare with me that the UI totally sucks and my coding style is not the best. Again: I coded this app for me and it works here with my setup. If it does not run on yours, you can drop me a note and if it is easy to fix, I will do my best to do so. But I am not a professional, so please be patient and nice ;-)

If you think you can do anything to improve the app, specifically:
* making a nice UI
* improving (i.e., speeding up) taking screenshots
* improving the color finding algorithm
* etc.

please feel free to do so. I would be extremely happy to work together with others. Of course, as this app is GPL3, you are also welcome to fork it and use it as a seed for your own project, as long as it remains open source ;-)
