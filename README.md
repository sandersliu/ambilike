# Ambilike
Ambilight like experience using a normal Android device and the Philips Hue system. Needs a rooted device.

# Recent changes
* Completely rebuild the GUI. It now uses the notification area to control the principal behavior.
* Rewrote the Hue backend. It is completely open source now!

# How to use
* Just download the apk file and install it.
* The app will automatically connect to your bridge.
* Push the "Light" button to choose the lights you want to use and fiddle around with the settings.

# Please note
This is should be considered as a "works-for-me proof of concept". It runs stable on my device and
the effect is not perfect but I enjoy it very much.
Again: I coded this app for me and it works here with my setup. If it does not run on yours,
you can drop me a note and if it is easy to fix, I will do my best to do so. But I am not a 
professional, so please be patient and nice.

If you think you can do anything to improve the app, specifically:
* making a nice UI
* improving (i.e., speeding up) taking screenshots
* improving the color finding algorithm
* etc.

please feel free to do so. I would be extremely happy to work together with others. Of course, as this app is GPL3, you are also welcome to fork it and use it as a seed for your own project, as long as it remains open source ;-)
